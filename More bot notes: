More bot notes:

Right now, find enemy is only called when it is in seek mode. (SOLVED)
Neat output needs to be connected to the correct server
Weird error, when the client is joining the game after the bots. No problems if it is the other way around
Adam crashes, due to numpy error if there is another bot 
Often hits a none-weapon number.
